# Twitch GQL

### I am archiving this repository because of the below however, will keep it up and public for reference (particularly since the overwhelming majority of elements of the schema are still a part of Twitch's current GQL API.

#### Twitch has disabled introspection on their schema which results in the retrieval of their schema being no longer possible.
#### The current version of the schema are the last retrieved before Twitch disabled introspection, retrieved only a few hours before Twitch disabled it.



This contains the current schema and introspected schema which can be viewed to browse the available queries of the GQL API.
